# s8-cnft
**Assignment:** Create a cNFT collection of your own profile picture and social links as metadata and airdrop it to other fellows.

I had some issues with my script, it crashed on some checks after the first mint. Since I didn't want to remove any code from the full script (`createCnft.js`) for the submission, I created a new script `createCnft_after_create_collection.js`, that mints to the pre-existing collection.
